### Purpose:
Digital Slot Inspection is a Windows interactive application that documents, organize, and displays regulatory violations found during a casino slot inspection.  

The application formats the list of violations into a downloadable and printable PDF formatted report. The money saved from paper costs and storage makes this an ideal replacement tool for the paper based process used today. 

The application is design to work in the field with a minimalist workflow process. A point and click methodology ensures users can document a violation or clear a slot machine of any issues in under a minute from a laptop. A simple tap of keyboard informs the user of their inspection progress. 

### Motivation: 
The original paper based process created an excessive amount of paperwork.  This paperwork had to be organized, reviewed for violations found, and stored daily. Human error alone lead to paperwork lost, violations overlooked during the review process, and an unmanageable storage issues. The process of starting an inspection or creating a final report of violations found was time consuming.
