Version Guildlines:
- Major: when you make incompatible API CHANGE (ex. online version to electron version)
- Minor: when you add functionalbity that is backwards compatiable
- Patch: when you fix bugs that is still backward compatiable

GREAT NOTE, MAY HELP ONE DAY
    reload: true //will reload controller when state is being access    
    
Great Note: File Organization:
- File folders should be Uppercase, MealBook
- Service files that support one file, html, should go in a folder with it instead of a seperate same name folder in js. Ex. js/mealbook(service, spec) and mealbook(html, spec).
- js should be for shared javascript files like services and app.js

***Place "container" and "container-fluids" inside your "rows" to cure whitespace on the side.

Notice BIG BUG:
When set in a support controller:
    //use the SlotMachine service to get the slot machine at the current location to setup a new currentSlotMachine    
    $scope.currentSlotMachine = SlotMachine.getCurrentSlotMachine();
    
    //assigns the slot machine, received as a parameter, location to the scope's location 
    $scope.location= $scope.currentSlotMachine.location;
        
    //assigns the slot machine, received as a parameter, serial number to the scope's serial number 
    $scope.serialNumber = $scope.currentSlotMachine.serialNumber;
    
    */ 
This create a activeEditorChang listeners error in the chrome tools. It did the correct wanted behavior of dynamic change slotmachine location in other controllers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
State What and Why/behavior for Commits (not how). 
Subject: State the feature/unit of work or Why. example: file name or Bug
Mesage: state the what/why or expected behavior

Services: State what area it supports, databases used, what functionality do in general.
Controller: what file is it for and what/where funtionaily it provides
html: what do the elements on it do
Unit tests: state the feature or area for subject. Then name the unit test file and which file (service or controller) it tests and its purpose.
---------
Inital application setup Files
The inital index.html and app.js used to start the development of the navigation feature. A libs folder containing relevent support files was copied from previous projects. 
-----------
Navigation Feature: nav.html
The nav.html file with backward, forward, and search buttons for selecting slot machines. A location and serial number is displayed to identify the current slot machine. 
----------
Navigation Feature: navController.js
The controller for the nav.html provides the functionality for the navigational buttons and updates the data to the output fields (location/serial number).
-----------
Navigation Feature: slotMachineService.js
A service to support the navigation controller with a database of slot machines and functionality to support the navigation buttons.

A service to support the button compliance issue with functionality to support the database of button issues, array of issues found, and button.html checkboxes.
------------
Button Feature: Unit Test
The buttonsService.spec.js is a unit test for the Button Service file. It ensures the expected behavior or output of each method/function is acheived.

Bug: Forward nav button not work after Search
Issue: After a user press the search button for a slot machine and then use the forward button, the navigation is broken. 
Fixed: I converted the index being assigned to currentLocation to a number in the search functionality. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unit Tests: The describe state the unit of work, the expect states the expected behavior with context/behavior or senario/results. Example: addToCount(), increase count by one.
- First develop the story, list the features from the story, then write unit tests to tests those those features.
- Afterward write unit tests for invalid, bad, or edge cases
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

var children = arrayA.concat(arrayB);
var d = a.concat(b, c);
ToDo:
****Reopen a skip machine****

- unit test for the Software controller 
- Update unit test for navController
- bug: After saving a slot and the next slot is already completed, the next slot gets the first data. Its not wiping clean. 
- Update slotMachine service unit test 
- Design Cog Page to display additonal choices such as help, list compliance issues.
- ComplianceService unit test
- Add ui-sef="nav" to each compliance issue chkbox and remove the "done" button for UX speed.
- add message to ask user are they sure they want to navigate away if compliance issue found but not save OR disable naviation if numberOfIssues is above 0.
